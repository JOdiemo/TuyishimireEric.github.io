In this project, I worked on a portfolio mobile version project and created two extra sections to add up to the original section. The sections created for the current project were: "works section" to showcase my previous projects I have worked on and the "about myself section" to showcase my programming experiences.
During the project, I have learned the following:

How to create cards
How to use Flexbox to position and align elements
How to use Grid layout to position elements
How to create cards and style them
